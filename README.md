# Python-Refreshers
A few little Python projects to refresh myself after some time away

blackjack.py is a text based blackjack game

calculator.py is a calculator that can handle multiple math equations and continue running as the user adds more input.

product_inventory.py is a simple project to create, list, load, and store a product inventory list.  This little program can
  load and save to a json file.
